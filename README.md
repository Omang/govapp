PROBLEM STATEMENT

 

The Botswana Trade Commission (BOTC) was established to administer international trade and industrial instruments, these are trade remedies, tariff management and rebates, infant industry protection as well as imports and exports regulation. The Local Authorities are mandated to issue permit for childcare centres, welfare institutions, temporary stall permit, burial permit, noise, and nuisance permit amongst another. The application, processing, and issuance of permits by these authorities is currently manual. The customer makes enquiry on application, collects application forms to complete and submit to the authorities for processing. The customer is then required to make payment at revenue office. All these processes require the customer to physical visit the offices to seek assistance. Currently there are challenges in the application and processing of these various permit. These challenges are:

 

Inefficient management of application and information due to the manual process of conducting business.

Application submission and processing is currently manual.

Payment processing is through the revenue office which operates during working hours, from 8:00 AM until 3:30 PM.

 

Expected outcome:

 

The Government of Botswana calls upon developers to develop a solution that will address the above challenges. The solution should have:

 

1. Timely and accurate application and management of services.

2. Reduced turnaround times for processing of applications.

3. To monitor and evaluate the process of issuing Permits and Certificates.

4. To have messaging functionality to ease communication with the clients.

5. To automate notifications and alerts.
